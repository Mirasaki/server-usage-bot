## Hosting

We have partnered with [VYKIX.com](https://portal.vykix.com/aff.php?aff=17) after observing many of our clients using VYKIX services and products. Check them out for affordable and reliable hosting, they bring the **best DayZ hosting experience possible.** ðŸ“ˆ

## Discord Permissions

The bot doesn't require any permissions

Invite the bot to your server by navigating to the following URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with `CLIENT_ID` from the `.env` file):

`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

Any command can be used without any Discord permissions, as long as the bot is invited to your server with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes. You can use the template url above, or alternatively, generate an invite link in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (Your App > OAuth2 > URL Generator > `scopes: bot + applications.commands`)
